# Godot Game Template
For Godot 4.2

This template has a main menu, pause menu, and credits scene. It supports basic accessibility features like input rebinding, sound, and video controls.

## Use Case
Setup menus and accessibility features in about 15 minutes.

The core components can support a larger project, but the template was originally built to support smaller projects and game jams.

## Features

### App (Base)

The `App/` folder holds the core components of the menus application.

-   Main Menu    
-   Options Menus
-   Pause Menu
-   Credits
-   Loading Screen
-   Persistent Settings
-   Simple Config Interface
-   Keyboard/Mouse Support
-   Gamepad Support

### Extras

The `Extras/` folder holds components that extend the core application.

-   Example Game Scene
-   Opening Scene
-   End Credits
-   Logging Scripts
-   Reset Logs Option
-   Additional Inherited Scenes from `App/`:
    -   `OptionsMenu.tscn`
    -   `MasterOptionsMenu.tscn`
    -   `MainMenu.tscn` 
    -   `PauseMenu.tscn`
    -   `InitApp.tscn`

  
### How it Works
- `SceneLoader.tscn` needs to be set to autoload. It works with `LoadingScreen.tscn` to load in scenes in cases where a progress bar will be shown.  
- `InitApp.tscn` is the project's main scene. It loads all the configuration settings from the config file (if it exists) into game. It then loads the next scene (`Opening.tscn` or `MainMenu.tscn`).  
- `Opening.tscn` is a simple scene for fading in/out a few images at the start of the game. It then loads the next scene (`MainMenu.tscn`).  
- `MainMenu.tscn` is where a player can start the game, change settings, watch credits, or quit. It can link to the path of a game scene to play, and the packed scene of an options menu to use.  
- `Credits.tscn` reads from `ATTRIBUTION.md` to automatically generate the content for it's scrolling text label.  
- `PauseMenu.tscn` works with `PauseMenuController.gd` and `InGameMenuController.gd`. `InGameMenuController.gd` needs to be set to autoload, and `PauseMenuController` is added onto a Node in a scene expected to be run in-game. Triggering `ui-cancel` in that scene will then bring up `PauseMenu.tscn` on a higher canvas layer.

## Usage

### App vs. Extras

To begin with, use the `Extras/` folder, and make changes there. However, to start minimally, use just the `App/` folder. Compare [Features](#features) to decide.

#### Minimal

If you just want to use just the projects minimum `App/` folder:

1.  Go to `Project > Project Settings… > General > Application > Run`.
2.  Update `Main Scene` to `res://App/Scenes/InitApp/InitApp.tscn`.
3.  Close the window.
    

The remaining instructions will apply the same for either folder you decide to use.

#### Extra Minimal

The pause menu feature can be removed if not used. From the `App/` folder, delete `PauseMenu/*`, `PauseMenuController.gd`, and `InGameMenuController.gd`. The last will need to be removed from the project's autoload, as well.

Lastly, this `README.md` and the `Media/` directory can both be removed.
